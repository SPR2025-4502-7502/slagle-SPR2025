                    <p>Gino’s East is a well-known Chicago restaurant that’s famous for its deep dish pizza. It first opened in 1966 and has become one of the city’s classic spots for authentic Chicago-style pizza. Their deep dish is known for a thick, buttery crust, lots of cheese, and a chunky tomato sauce. One thing that makes the original downtown location stand out is that the walls are completely covered in graffiti from customers over the years. Gino’s East now has several locations, but the original ones in Chicago are still the most iconic.</p>

                    <p>Giordano’s is a Chicago restaurant best known for its stuffed deep dish pizza. It started in 1974, when brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, who were originally from Italy, opened the first location on Chicago’s South Side. Their style of deep dish is different because it’s a stuffed pizza — it has two layers of crust with cheese and toppings inside, then a layer of sauce on top. Giordano’s has grown into one of the most recognized names for Chicago-style pizza, with locations across the city, the suburbs, and even in other states. Their focus is on a rich, hearty pizza that’s heavier and cheesier than a traditional deep dish.</p>

                    <p>Pizano’s Pizza & Pasta is a Chicago restaurant known for both its deep dish and thin crust pizzas. It was opened in 1991 by Rudy Malnati Jr., whose father, Rudy Malnati Sr., helped create the original Chicago deep dish at Pizzeria Uno. Pizano’s deep dish is similar to the original style — it has a buttery crust, rich tomato sauce, and a focus on fresh ingredients — but it’s known for being a little lighter and crispier than other deep dish places. Pizano’s has several locations around Chicago and is often praised for offering both classic deep dish and a popular thin crust option, giving people more variety depending on what they’re looking for.</p>

                    <p>Rosati’s Pizza is a Chicago-based pizza chain that started in 1964. It was founded by Saverio Rosati, whose family had a long history in the restaurant business. Rosati’s is known for offering a variety of pizzas, including Chicago-style deep dish, but they are especially popular for their thin crust and tavern-style pizza, which is cut into squares. Rosati’s focuses on traditional recipes, using fresh ingredients and a slightly sweeter tomato sauce. Over time, it has grown into a national chain, with locations all over the United States, but it still promotes its Chicago roots and family-owned history.</p>

                    <p>Pizzeria Uno is the original restaurant where Chicago-style deep dish pizza was created. It opened in 1943 in downtown Chicago, founded by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo. Pizzeria Uno’s deep dish style was different from traditional pizza because it had a thick, buttery crust, layers of cheese, meat, and vegetables, all topped with a chunky tomato sauce. The success of Pizzeria Uno helped make deep dish pizza a Chicago tradition. Today, there are Pizzeria Uno locations across the country, but the original restaurant in Chicago is still seen as a historic landmark for pizza lovers.</p>
