        <p>Hi, I’m Morgan Slagle! I’m a junior from the suburbs of Chicago, studying journalism with a focus on social and audience strategy, alongside a minor in business. I’m passionate about social media marketing and building meaningful connections with audiences. This semester, I’m excited to begin two new roles: Director of Public Relations for Alpha Delta Pi and Director of Finance for the American Advertising Federation. I look forward to continuing to share the experiences and accomplishments I have gained in these roles!</p>
